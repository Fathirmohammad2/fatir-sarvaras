                <h2>My hobby is <br>playing online games</h2>
                <p>I often play online games can be a positive hobby if done wisely. In addition to training strategic and problem-solving skills, online games can also improve teamwork and communication skills, especially in team-based games. On the other hand, games also provide entertainment, reduce stress, and even help develop reflexes and hand-eye coordination. This hobby also allows us to connect with the global community and make new friends. The important thing is to make sure to balance it with other activities!
