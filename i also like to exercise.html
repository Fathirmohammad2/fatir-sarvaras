                <h2>I also <br> like to exercise</h2>
                <p>I love exercising because exercising is a hobby that brings many positive benefits. In addition to keeping the body fit and healthy, exercise also helps improve mood, reduce stress, and increase energy. Regular physical activity can strengthen muscles, bones, and increase endurance. In addition, exercise trains discipline and perseverance, and is a means to set and achieve personal goals. By exercising, we can also build healthy living habits that have a good impact in the long term!
