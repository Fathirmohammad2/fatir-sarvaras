                <h2>Traveling <br>
                    Abroad</h2>
                <p>I also love traveling because traveling is a hobby that opens many doors to new experiences and enriches insight. Through travel, we can explore new places, get to know different cultures, and meet people from various backgrounds. Traveling also provides an opportunity to learn new things, whether about history, cuisine, or local customs. In addition, traveling helps us to get out of our comfort zone, face new challenges, and refresh our minds. This hobby is not only about enjoying beautiful scenery, but also about broadening our perspectives and creating valuable memories.
