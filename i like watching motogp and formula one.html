                <h2>I like watching <br> MotoGP and Formula One</h2>
                <p>MotoGP gives Fatir a different sensation. He is fascinated by the riders’ techniques in cornering and controlling the motorbike perfectly. He often practices racing techniques on deserted roads, imagining himself as Valentino Rossi or Marc Márquez, feeling the racing spirit in every lap. On the other hand, Formula One captivates him with its technology and strategy. Fatir loves to study every detail of the car, from aerodynamics to pit stop strategy. He is also fascinated by the drama that occurs on the track, such as the tight competition between big teams and how quick decisions can change the outcome of a race.
